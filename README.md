# Profiles REST API

Profiles REST API course code.

- Setup up Vagrant development serer

`` vagrant init ubuntu/bionic64 ``

- above command will initialise our project with the new vigrant file

``vagrant up // to start the vagrant server for our project  ``

``vagrant ssh   // to connect to the vagrant server ``
- By default local system file is not sync on our development virtual server and as we know our code is on local server and vagrant work by creating a synchronised directory on our vagrant server

`` cd vagrant // this commend will show you all local file which is on server``
